# Hospital-OR-Scheduling
Being a data scientist in the healthcare domain and a true mathematician at heart, I have always been fascinated with how complex systems such as that of hospitals efficiently utilize optimization algorithms to make the maximum use of their skilled manpower ensuring highest standards of patient care. This project is based on a case study taken from Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, CA and how they enabled their organization in determining an efficient weekly schedule to assign operating rooms (ORs) to different departments in a hospital with limited resources.
